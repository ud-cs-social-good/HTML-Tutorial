	<p1> This is a paragraph: Boiled eggs are eggs, typically from a chicken, cooked with their shells unbroken, 
	usually by immersion in boiling water. Hard-boiled eggs are cooked so that the egg white and egg yolk both solidify, 
	while soft-boiled eggs may leave the yolk, and sometimes the white, at least partially liquid and raw. Boiled eggs 
	are a popular breakfast food around the world. Besides a boiling water immersion, there are a few different methods 
	to make boiled eggs. Eggs can also be cooked below the boiling temperature, i.e. coddling, or they can be steamed.
