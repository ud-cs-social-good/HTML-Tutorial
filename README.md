## Creating an HTML File
HTML files are composed of content called elements. Tags are used to indicate the
start and end of an element and are generally formated as follows:
```
<tag-name> content </tag-name>
```

The first line of an HTML file should always be a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration.
This line is not actually an HTML tag, but instead is an instruction that
communicates the version of HTML being used to the browser viewing the page. In
the starter file we say `<!DOCTYPE html>` to specify that we are using HTML5

The first tag you'll see in an HTML file is `<html>` which is the root element
of a page. The content of an HTML file will be contain between the `<html>` and
`</html>` tags

## Instructions
Create an html file using the starter template that will contain some fact or
info about Newark's Housing laws/codes.

## Useful Tags
Some tags that may help you get started:
* Specify meta information about a page (like page title): `<head> ... </head>`
* Specify a page's title: `<title> ... </title>`
* Specify a page's visible content: `<body> ... </body>`
* Create a large heading: `<h1> ... </h1>`
* Create a smaller heading: `<h2> ... </h2>`
* Create a paragraph: `<p> ... </p>`
